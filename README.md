The goal of the project is to create a website where users can find movies, TV shows, or TV series, explore detailed information about them, watch trailers, view the list of actors, discover on which platforms they can watch the content, read reviews, learn more about different actors, and add movies or TV series to their favorites. 

I developed a full-stack project using Next.js, integrating frontend and backend functionalities seamlessly. This web application revolves around leveraging a public API that provides comprehensive data on movies and TV shows.

Frontend Development:

- Designed and developed over 5 pages to ensure a cohesive user experience.
- Implemented swipers using Swiper.js for smooth content browsing.
- Integrated pagination for easy navigation through extensive lists of media.
- Employed Framer Motion for animated elements to enrich user interactions.
- Developed authentication and registration forms with TypeScript and NextAuth for secure user access.
- Implemented search fields and advanced filters for efficient content discovery.
- 
Backend Development:

- Created a PostgreSQL database using Prisma ORM for robust data management.
- Implemented user data storage and favorite lists functionality.
  Technologies Used:
- Frontend: TypeScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Swiper.js
- Backend: PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM
- Authentication: NextAuth
- Deployment & Version Control: GitHub, Vercel
