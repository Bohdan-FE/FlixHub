The goal of the project is to create a website where users can find movies, TV shows, or TV series, explore detailed information about them, watch trailers, view the list of actors, discover on which platforms they can watch the content, read reviews, learn more about different actors, and add movies or TV series to their favorites. I developed this site to enhance my skills in React and Next.js.

This project stands out because it is extensive, being a full-stack project with over 10 pages. It includes user authentication and a database where information about registered users and their favorite movies or TV series is stored.

The technology stack used for this project includes TypeScript, React, Next.js, NextAuth, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
